@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the TIM peripheral to generate a One pulse Mode 
after a Rising edge of an external signal is received in Timer Input pin.


Clock setup for TIM1
================================

  TIM1CLK = SystemCoreClock = 64 MHz.
  
  Prescaler = (TIM1CLK /TIM1 counter clock) - 1
  
  The prescaler value is computed in order to have TIM1 counter clock 
  set at 16000000 Hz.
  
  The Autoreload value is 65535 (TIM1->ARR), so the maximum frequency value to 
  trigger the TIM1 input is 16000000/65535 [Hz].
 
Configuration of TIM1 in One Pulse Mode
===================================================
 
  - The external signal is connected to TIM1_CH2 pin (PE.11), 
    and a rising edge on this input is used to trigger the Timer.
  - The One Pulse signal is output on TIM1_CH1 (PE.09).

  The delay value is fixed to:
   - Delay =  CCR1/TIM1 counter clock 
           = 16383 / 16000000 [sec]
           
  The pulse value is fixed to : 
   - Pulse value = (TIM_Period - TIM_Pulse)/TIM1 counter clock  
                 = (65535 - 16383) / 16000000 [sec]

  The one pulse waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope and it looks
  like this.

@par Hardware and Software environment

   - This example runs on STM32F303ZE devices.
   - In this example, the clock is set to 64 MHz.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F303ZE-Nucleo Rev B board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32F303ZE-Nucleo Rev B Set-up
   - Connect the external signal to the TIM1_CH2 pin (PE.11) (Arduino D5 - connected to pin 6 on CN10 Connector)
   - Connect the TIM1_CH1 pin(PE.09) (Arduino D6 - connected to pin 4 on CN10 Connector) to an oscilloscope to monitor the waveform.  


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
 - Load project image: Project->Download and Debug
 - Run program: Debug->Go(F5)
