@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use two ADC peripherals to
perform conversions in interleaved dual-mode.

The ADC1 and ADC2 are configured to convert ADC_CHANNEL_7, with conversion 
triggered by software.

The Dual interleaved delay is configured to 6 ADC clk cycles (ADC_TWOSAMPLINGDELAY_6CYCLES).

On each DMA request (two data items are available) two bytes representing two 
ADC-converted data items are transferred as a half word to uhADCDualConvertedValue variable.

A DMA request is generated each time 2 data items are available
1st request: ADC_CDR[15:0] = (ADC2_DR[7:0] << 8) | ADC1_DR[7:0] 
2nd request: ADC_CDR[15:0] = (ADC2_DR[7:0] << 8) | ADC1_DR[7:0]

In this example, 
  the system clock is 72MHz, 
  HCLOCK is 72MHz            (AHB Prescaler = 1 from SystemClock_Config())
  ADC clock = HCLOCK / 2.    (ADC_CLOCK_SYNC_PCLK_DIV2 from ADC_Config())
            = 36 MHz
            
  Sample time:     4.5 cycles (set using ADC_SAMPLETIME_4CYCLES_5).
  Convertion time: 8.5 cycles (set using ADC_RESOLUTION_8B (refer to reference manual)).
  Delay time:      6 cycles   (set using ADC_TWOSAMPLINGDELAY_6CYCLES).

You get 2 samples each (Sample time + Delay time) X 2 = 21 cycles. This implies a conversion rate of 10.5 cycles.
  => ADC are working at 36MHz/10.5cycles = 3.4Msps.

The ADC measure is realized on PC.01. You can modify the voltage on PC.01 by turning potentiometer RV2.

STM32 board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED1 is ON when the conversion is complete.
 - LED3 is ON when there are an error in initialization. 
  
@note Refer to "simulation.xls" file to have the diagram simulation of the example.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F303xC devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM32303C-EVAL evaluation board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board. 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
