@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the different BSP drivers. 

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock 
(SYSCLK) to run at 72 MHz.

This example shows how to use the different functionalities of LCD, SD card, 
eeprom, temperature sensor, joystick, audio playback and CEC-HDMI by switching 
between all tests using key button. 

 ** Push the Key button to start first Test.  
Blue Led (LD4) will blink between each test.Press key button to start another test:

 ** JOSTICK **
Use the joystick button to move a pointer inside a rectangle (up/down/right/left) 
and change the pointer color(select).

 ** LCD **
This example shows how to use the different LCD features to display string with 
different fonts, to display different shapes and to draw a bitmap.

 ** SD **
This example shows how to erase, write and read the SD card and also how to detect 
the presence of the card.

 ** EEPROM **
This example shows how to read and write data in EEPROM I2C ANT7-M24LR-A connected 
on STM32373C-EVAL RevB or EEPROM I2C M24M01-HR mounted on STM32373C-EVAL RevB: 
   * The I2C RF EEPROM memory (ANT7-M24LR-A) is available thru the connector CN3.
   @note Make sure that JP4 and JP5 set to I2C2 position.
   * The I2C EEPROM memory (M24M01-HR) is directly mounted on STM32373C-EVAL RevB
   @note Make sure that JP4 and JP5 set to I2C2_F position

 ** TSENSOR **
This example show how to read a Temperature using the temperature sensor.
@note Make sure that JP4 and JP5 set to I2C2 position.

 ** AUDIO **
This example show how to play/pause/resume or change the volume (min 0% / max 100 %)
of an audio playback using Joystick button.
@note Make sure that JP4 and JP5 set to I2C2 position.
      Plug a headphone to ear the sound  /!\ Take care of yours ears.
      Default volume is 60%.
      A press of JOY_SEL button will pause the audio file play (LED 1 green keep 
       previous state and LED2 orange ON).
      Another press on JOY_SEL button will resumes audio file play (only LED 1 
       green blink at each replay)
      @Note: Copy file 'audio.bin' directly in the flash at @0x08015000 using ST-Link utility

 ** CEC **
This example shows how to initialize and detect the devices connected on the HDMI-CEC 
according the device type choosen. It displays the received messages. The board 
can be configured as ROOT or not and with the use of HDMI-DDC or not.
@note Make sure that JP4 and JP5 set to I2C2 position.
@note Connect HDMI cable to HDMI_SOURCE with another device which support HDMI connection.
@note If the board is configured as ROOT, connect HDMI cable to HDMI_SINK (HDMI-DDC 
       should be used in this case)
@note If the HDMI-DDC is used, one device should be ROOT (not possible to have only 
       source devices)

</!\ Be careful : HDMI-CEC has same I2C address than RF EEPROM ANT7-M24LR-A /!\>

 ** LCD LOG **
This example show how to use the LCD log features.

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This example runs on STM32F373C devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32373C-EVAL RevB
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Copy file 'audio.bin' directly in the flash at @0x08015000 using ST-Link utility
 - Run the example
