@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the TSC to perform continuous acquisitions
of one channel in polling mode.

When the end of acquisition occurs, the acquired data is affected to the
uhTSCAcquisitionValue variable.

STM32 Eval board's LEDs are used as follows:
  - LED1, LED2 and LED3 show the touch activity (low to high pressure)
  - LED4 toggles when an error occurs (TSC initialization, TSC start or assert).

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F373xC devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM32373C-EVAL board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
