@par Example Description 

This example provides basic implementation of audio features.
It allows to play an audio file through the I2S peripheral and DMA-based transfer
and using the external codec implemented on the STM32373C-EVAL board.

In this example the I2S input clock, provided by a dedicated PLL (PLLI2S),  is
configured to have an audio sampling frequency at 8 KHz with Master clock enabled.

This example uses an audio codec driver which consists of two independent layers:
 - Codec Hardware layer: which controls and communicates with the audio codec 
   (CS43L22) implemented on the evaluation board.
 - The high layer: which implements overall control and interfacing API allowing
   to perform basic audio operations (Init, Play, Pause, Resume, Stop, Volume 
   control and audio file pointer management)
  
In this example the audio file is stored in the internal flash memory (Mono, 
16-bit, 8 KHz). The analog output device is automatically detected (Speaker or 
Headphone) when the Headphone is plugged/unplugged in/from the audio jack of the 
evaluation board. The example also manages information display and control interface
through push buttons: 
 - When the application is Playing audio file:
     + Key          : Pause
     + Joystick up  : Volume UP
     + Joystick down: Volume DOWN
 - When the application is Paused:
     + Key          : Play
     + Joystick up  : Switch output target to Headphone
     + Joystick down: Switch output target to Speaker

This example plays the audio file stored in internal flash memory and replays it
when it reaches end of file. But it can be tailored to used different media storage
devices (SDCard (through SDIO), external Memory (through FSMC) ...) or to play 
in streaming mode (ie. from USB port in device or host mode). In this case, Circular
DMA mode should be preferred (by enabling the define DMA_CIRCULAR in
I2Sx_MspInit() API of stm32373c_eval_audio.c file).  

List of Known Limitations and more detailed user notes are provided in file 
stm32373c_eval_audio.c   (under Drivers\BSP\STM32373C_EVAL)

The provided sample Audio file (stored in internal Flash memory) is extracted from:
  - Title: Partita E major, Gavotte en rondeau  
  - Artist/Composer: J.-S. Bach


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment  
  - This example runs on STM32F373xx devices.    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32373C-EVAL RevC 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32373C-EVAL Set-up
    - Jumper JP4 and JP5 need to be set in I2C2 position.

@par How to use it ? 

   
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
 - Connect a headphone or a speaker to the audio jack connector (CN11).
