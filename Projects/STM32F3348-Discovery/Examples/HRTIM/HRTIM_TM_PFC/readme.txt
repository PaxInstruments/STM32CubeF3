@par Example Description 
  This example shows how to configure the HRTIM to control a transition mode PFC.
 
  This is done with the TD1 output (PB14).
  The TD1 control signal has a constant Ton time and variable frequency.
  
  To exercice fully the demo, it is necessary to simulate the feedback signals:
  - Over-current signal ("OC", on EEV3/PB7)
  - Zero-crossing detection signal ("ZCD", on EEV4/PB6)
  
  The OC signal is filtered so has to have a minimum ON time guaranteed and 
  filter-out noise occuring at the Turn on time.
  The ZCD signal is conditioned so as to have:
  - a maximum operating frequency in case of too frequent ZCD information
  - a timeout in case no ZCD is present
  
  The various operating modes can be tested with function generator:
  - if the OC signal is generated during the Ton time, the pulse will be shortened
  - the ZCD signal is resetting the timer counter and will cause the switching 
  frequency to be changed accordingly.
  
  The FAULT1 input is enabled on PA12 (active low) to demonstrate PWM shut down 
  (low level sensitive).
  When the fault is triggered (PA12 input connected to GND, TD1 signal only is
  stopped. The system can be re-armed by pressing the user button.

  LEDs are indicating the following:
  Green LED: blinks during normal operation
  Orange LED: blinks when FAULT is triggered


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F334x4/STM32F334x6/STM32F334x8 devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F3348-DISCO
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
  
  - STM32F3348-DISCO Set-up: PA12 must be briefly tied to ground to simulate a fault event

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
