@par Demo Description

The provided demonstration firmware helps you to discover  STM32F3348-DISCO board
it can be used as reference to build any new firmware application for STM32F334R8
devices.


In Normal mode (User button not pressed at startup) :
  - OFF Mode :
    - BUCK LED is off, only LEDs are blinking
    - Time between the blinking decreased
  - DIMMER Mode (press USER button) :
    - LED intensity is automatically increased then decreased
    - Red LED is ON when intensity increased
    - Blue LED is ON when intensity decreased
  - FLASH Mode (press USER button) :
    - LED is driven @10Hz frequency (20% time ON) at maximum intensity
    - Green and orange LEDs toggle alternatively
  - Manual Mode (long press on USER button) :
    - LED Intensity is adjusted manually by keeping pressed USER button
    - LED intensity increase or decrease alternatively
    - Always starts with low intensity value for first time


In Test mode (User button pressed at startup) :
  - VIN should be connected to 5V_O
  - Green and blue LEDs blink quickly to indicate test mode
  - BOOST mode test (when releasing User button)
    - VOUT voltage equals to 10V (can be controlled by multimeter)
    - Green LED is ON and blue LED is blinking
  - BUCK mode test (press USER button) :
    - VOUT voltage equals to 2V (can be controlled by multimeter)
    - Blue LED is ON and green LED is blinking
  - LEDs test (press USER button) :
    - All four LEDs are blinking
    
  - If orange LED is blinking :
    - VIN voltage is not available or not in the 4.5V to 5.5V range
    - VIN voltage's ADC acquisition is not correctly done (incorrect ADC values or timeout)
  - If red LED is blinking :
    - BUCK or BOOST mode regulation don't work (target voltage not reached before timeout)
    - VIN voltage released during the BUCK or BOOST mode

  (*) If VIN is not connected to +5V, after green and blue LEDs blink quickly to indicate test mode,
      when releasing User button, all four LEDS are turned ON.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This Demonstration has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F3348-DISCO board 
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
  - This Demonstration runs on STM32F334R8 Devices.  

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Open your preferred toolchain 
- Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
