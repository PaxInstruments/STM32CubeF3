@par Example Description 

This directory contains a binary template (in DFU format) to be loaded into 
Flash memory using Device Firmware Upgrade application.

This file was converted to the DFU format using the "DFU File Manager Tool" included in the "DfuSe" PC software install.
For more details on how to convert a .bin file to DFU format please refer to the
UM0412 user manual "Getting started with DfuSe USB device firmware upgrade STMicroelectronics extension"
available from the STMicroelectronics microcontroller website www.st.com.
   
This binary is a simple LED toggling.
The system Timer (Systick) is used for to generate the delay.
The offset address of this binary is 0x08007000 which matches the definition in
DFU application "USBD_DFU_APP_DEFAULT_ADD".


@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F303xE devices
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F303RE-Nucleo Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
