@par Example Description

This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral to generate 3 PWM combined 
signals.

This is done using TIM1 peripheral to generate 3 PWM combined signals with TIM1 Channel5.

TIM1 input clock (TIM1CLK) is set to APB2 clock (PCLK2)=> TIM1CLK = PCLK2 = SystemCoreClock
TIM1CLK = SystemCoreClock, Prescaler = 0, TIM1 counter clock = SystemCoreClock
SystemCoreClock is set to 72 MHz for STM32F303xC devices.

The objective is to generate 3 combined PWM signal at 8.78 KHz (in center aligned mode):
    - TIM1_Period = (SystemCoreClock / (8.78*2)) - 1
 The channel 1  duty cycle is set to 50%.
 The channel 2  duty cycle is set to 37.5%.
 The channel 3  duty cycle is set to 25%.

The Timer pulse is calculated as follows:
  - ChannelxPulse = DutyCycle * (TIM1_Period - 1) / 100
  
The channel 5  is used in PWM2 mode with duty cycle set to 6.22%.

The 3 resulting signals are made of an AND logical combination of two reference PWMs:
  - Channel 1 and Channel 5
  - Channel 2 and Channel 5
  - Channel 3 and Channel 5

The TIM1 waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This example runs on STM32F303xC devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F3-Discovery RevB
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32F3-Discovery RevB Set-up
    - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different 
      waveforms:
       - PA.08 (TIM1_CH1)
       - PA.09 (TIM1_CH2)
       - PA.10 (TIM1_CH3)

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
