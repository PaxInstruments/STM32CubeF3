@par Example Description 

This example shows how to update at regular period the IWDG reload counter and 
how to simulate a software fault generating an MCU IWDG reset on expiry of a 
programmed time period, using  HAL IWDG API.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 72 MHz.

The IWDG timeout is set to 762 ms (the timeout may varies due to LSI frequency 
dispersion).

The Window option is enabled with a window register value set to 400 ms.
To prevent a reset, the downcounter must be reloaded when its value is:
	-lower than the window register value (400ms)
	-greater than 0x0
The IWDG counter is therefore refreshed each 450 ms in the main program infinite loop to 
prevent a IWDG reset.
LED7 is also toggled each xxx ms indicating that the program is running. 

An EXTI Line is connected to a GPIO pin, and configured to generate an interrupt
on the rising edge of the signal.

The EXTI Line is used to simulate a software failure: once the EXTI Line event 
occurs, by pressing the Key push-button, the corresponding interrupt is served.
In the ISR, a write to invalid address generates a Hardfault exception containing
an infinite loop and preventing to return to main program (the IWDG counter is 
not refreshed).
As a result, when the IWDG counter falls to 0, the IWDG reset occurs.
If the IWDG reset is generated, after the system resumes from reset, LED5 turns on.

If the EXTI Line event does not occur, the IWDG counter is indefinitely refreshed
in the main program infinite loop, and there is no IWDG reset.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F303xC devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F3 Discovery board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.   


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
