@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the different BSP drivers. 

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 72 MHz.

This example shows how to use the different functionalities of LCD, SD card, 
eeprom, temperatue sensor and joystick by switching 
between all tests using key button. 

 ** Push the User button to start first Test.  
Blue Led (LD4) will blink between each test.Press user key to start another test:

 ** JOSTICK **
Use the joystick button to move a pointer inside a rectangle 
(up/down/right/left) and change the pointer color(select).

 ** LCD **
This example shows how to use the different LCD features to display string
with different fonts, to display different shapes and to draw a bitmap.

 ** SD **
This example shows how to erase, write and read the SD card and also 
how to detect the presence of the card.

 ** EEPROM **
This example show how to read and write data in EEPROM I2C M24LR64 connected on STM32303E-EVAL RevC
then EEPROM SPI M95M01 mounted on STM32303E-EVAL RevC:
   * The I2C RF EEPROM memory (M24LR64) is available thru the connector CN1.
   @note Make sure that JP8 (EEPROM WP) is closed, and JP5, JP6 set to I2C2 position.
   * The SPI EEPROM memory (M95M01) is directly mounted on STM32303E-EVAL RevC
   @note No specific jumper to communicate with this EEPROM M95M01

 ** TSENSOR **
This example show how to read a Temperature using the temperature sensor.
@note Make sure that JP5 and JP6 set to I2C2 position.

 ** AUDIO **
This example show how to play/pause/resume or change the volume (min 50% / max 100 %)
of an audio playback using Key or Joystick button.
@note Make sure that JP5 and JP6 set to I2C2 position.
      Plug a headphone to ear the sound  /!\ Take care of yours ears.
      Default volume is 60%.
      A press of JOY_SEL button will pause the audio file play (LED 1 green keep previous state
       and LED2 orange ON).
      Another press on JOY_SEL button will resumes audio file play (only LED 1 green blink at each replay)
      @Note: Copy file 'audio.bin' directly in the flash at @0x0800F000 using ST-Link utility


 ** LCD LOG **
This example show how to use the LCD log features.

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This example runs on STM32F303xE devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303E-EVAL RevC
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
