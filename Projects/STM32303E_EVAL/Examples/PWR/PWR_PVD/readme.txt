@par Example Description 
This example shows how to configure the programmable voltage detector using
an external interrupt line.

External DC supply has to be used to power Vdd.
In this example, EXTI line 16 is configured to generate an interrupt on each rising
or falling edge of the PVD output signal (which indicates that the Vdd voltage is
moving below or above the PVD threshold set to 2.5V). As long as the voltage is above the 
target threshold (2.5V), LED1 is blinking with a 200 ms-period; when the voltage drops
below the threshold, LED1 stops blinking and remains constantly on (or appears
to be turned off if the voltage is getting really low); when the voltage moves back
above the target threshold, LED1 starts blinking again.
If LED2 is on, it means that the system has generated an error.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F303xE devices
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303E-EVAL RevC
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - STM32303E-EVAL RevC Set-up
    To apply an external power supply input, the user can resort to
    pin 24 (VDD) of the daughter board extension connector CN7 and any GND pin
    of the same connector (pin 1, 10, 30, 39 or 50)
    Next,         
    - LED_GREEN (LED1) connected to PE.08 pin indicates the behavior of
    the test software as explained above.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
